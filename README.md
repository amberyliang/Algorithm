# Algorithm
Using top-down ( divide and conqure/ pure recursive)  and bottom-up  (dynamic-programming-like) methods to calculate the n-th Fibonacci Number, denoted as F(n).
There are two files.

File #1, named as "count2". 
The request as follow "Write code to measure the execution time of F(1), F(2), ..., F(100) using both methods. Plot the results as a line chart. (if your program crashes during computation F(n+1) or takes too much time (>12hours) to compute one value, you can just stop and report the maximum value of n.)".

File #2, named as "F(4)".
The request as follow "Let's measure the degree of overlapping subproblem. Calculate the times are F(4) computed when we compute F(5),F(6),.....,F(50). Plot the results into line chart."
